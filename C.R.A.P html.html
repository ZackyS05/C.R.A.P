<h3> How I used C.R.A.P:</h3>
<ul>
    <ol><h4>Contrast:</h4> <p>I used a light black background because it has some contrast in it. I then added gold color around the borders to make it look nice and to draw attention. I made the words of C.R.A.P big to show it's importance and to attract the reader's eyes.</p></ol>
    <ol><h4>Repetition:</h4> <p> I used repetition in this by adding the overline over the words of C.R.A.P. I also repeatedly added borders around the headings, paragraphs, and pictures to make the page look nice and neat.</p></ol>
    <ol><h4>Alignment:</h4> <p> I used alignment by arranging the images to the right and then to the left to make it look neat. I also aligned the text vertically right next to the image, so it does not look out of place.</p></ol>
    <ol><h4>Proximity:</h4><p> I used proximity by grouping the headings and definitions to the corect image in order to tell the reader what it means. I also spaced them away from eachother and used lines to seperate them. I did that, so it would make it easier to read and to look at the different images and definitions.</p></ol>
</ul>
